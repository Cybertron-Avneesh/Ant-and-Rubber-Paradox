 An ant is sitting at the left end of a rope of length 10 cm. At t=0 the ant starts moving
along the rope to reach the other end of the rope. The ant has a speed of 1 cm per second.
 After every second the rope stretches instantaneously and uniformly (along its length) by
10 cm with the left end fixed at the point from where the ant started its journey. Suppose
that the ant's legs provide it sufficient friction in order to withstand the stretching of the
rope.
a) Write a program to demonstrate that the ant will be able to reach the right end of the
rope.
b) Your program should also calculate how many seconds the ant would take to achieve
this goal. You may assume that the length of the ant is negligible (i.e., zero).


Note: The ant would reach the right end of the rope, even if its initial length and
stretching per second were 1 km (or even a billion kilometers) instead of 10 cm. But for
these dimensions the ant would take such an unbelievably large time that your program
will not give you the confirmation in your life-time. Moreover, you will require more
precision than what double can provide. Try to solve this puzzle mathematically.


I have wrote down the code for bove problem in C.
